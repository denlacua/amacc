Biology is the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy. Biology is a vast and diverse field that covers many topics and disciplines, such as anatomy, physiology, genetics, ecology, microbiology, zoology, botany, and more. Biology is also related to other sciences, such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computer science.
 
A biology dictionary is a useful tool for anyone who wants to learn more about biology or improve their vocabulary and comprehension of scientific terms. A biology dictionary can help you understand the meaning and pronunciation of words that are used in biology textbooks, articles, lectures, experiments, and reports. A biology dictionary can also help you expand your knowledge and curiosity about the natural world and its phenomena.
 
A bilingual biology dictionary is even more beneficial for people who speak or learn more than one language. A bilingual biology dictionary can help you translate words and concepts from one language to another, and compare the similarities and differences between them. A bilingual biology dictionary can also help you communicate with other people who share your interest in biology but speak a different language.
